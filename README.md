#Static View Browser

StaticView Browser lets you enter a URL and see a non-interactive rendering of that page. The server downloads the HTML, strips active content (scripts, forms, iframes, inline event handlers), rewrites links so you can navigate read-only within the same viewer, and proxies images so they load through the server. The UI mimics a classic Internet Explorer address bar and toolbar for a familiar, research-friendly feel. No client-side JavaScript runs, no logins or cookies are handled, and nothing is stored—making it suitable for classroom demos, audits, and content inspection where safety and minimalism matter.

#Key points

* Server-fetched, client-safe: The page is fetched by the server and presented as sanitized HTML.
* No execution: JavaScript is not executed in the user’s browser; interactive features are removed.
* Read-only navigation: Anchor tags are rewritten so you can click through pages in static mode.
* Image pass-through: Images load via the server to keep the view consistent.
* Retro UI: An IE-style chrome (title bar, toolbar, address bar + Go) for a browser-like experience.

#Intended use

* Coursework, demonstrations, and research where you need to inspect markup and layout safely.
* Quick static previews of public pages without handling authentication or user data.

#Not designed for

* ircumventing access controls or content restrictions.
* Interactive use cases (forms, logins, client JS apps).
* Perfect visual parity on heavily JS-driven sites.
